Naming

■■■ longer more descriptive names are better than short unclear ones ■■■
all variables are lowercase with underscores - 'some_variable'
all function names are lowercase, but uppercase with additional words, no underscores - 'someFunction()'
files are lowercase, but uppercase with additional words, no underscores - 'someImportantFile'
classes are uppercase - 'SomeClass'


Practices

when possible, put functions in functions.js
    comment for each function you add: what its for and what its preconditions are
don't pass scene to functions, just use current_scene instead
when possible, pool and reuse objects instead of deleting them
